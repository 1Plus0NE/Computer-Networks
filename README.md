# Computer Networks

## Grade: 17/20 ⭐

These projects were developed for the Computer Networks (pt: Redes de Computadores) course in the Software Engineering degree at Minho's University. The main tools used were Wireshark and the CORE platform (Common Open Research Emulator).

CORE is an open-source, real-time network emulator that leverages OS-level virtualization to simulate both wired and wireless networks. It allows protocols and applications to run unmodified and can interface with real networks, enabling integration with physical devices for extended testing environments.
